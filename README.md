# Nexter

A flexible and responsive web application for a Real Estate Company

## Nexter is built with modern web technologies such as Sassy SASS (SCSS), flexible grid and flexbox layouts.

### Development build process

- run npm install to download all dev dependencies

- npm start will automatically run live-server and also enable sass watch for changes at the same time.
  Note: live-server must first be installed on your local device.

- As an independent task, you can compile and auto-prefix the main SASS file for browser compatiblity, or run these tasks in parallel.
  Note: auto-prefix supports the last 10 versions of modern browsers.

- npm build:css will compile, auto-prefix and compress (minify) your SASS file.
